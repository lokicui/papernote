通过一遍过滤文档的方式，找出所需要的工作经验/技能/教育等信息。

主要用的nlp技术是规则匹配，其实就是用一堆关键词去查找。

存在问题，1）需要首先构建一个知识库，而且有人工标注

2）规则匹配过程中的那些规则人工创建的局限性太大

3）部分抽取有明显问题，如人名抽取，只看前几行找人名实在是太navie了}

主要采用HMM和SVM来进行简历解析。

首先，假设简历的模块以自然段为分割。在这个假设的基础上用HMM模型来预测每一段可能的归属，然后进行分类标注。

然后，将上一步完成的分类标注进行细粒度的抽取。利用svm多分类器方法，对不同的属性进行单独抽取。

实验在1200个简历上进行，效果还可以。

缺点：只是抽取重要信息，具体的工作经历/工作单位等等都没有详细处理。},
