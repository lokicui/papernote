	第一步：采用manifold learning的方法将句子的权重计算出来
	
	
	1）先将句子进行相似度计算，cosin
	
	
	2）计算句子的矩阵，将相似度矩阵分为 同一个文档的句子 和 不同文档的句子 的相似度之和
	
	W = lambda1 W1 + (1-lambda) W2
	
	
	3）找出转义矩阵 S = D^(-1/2) W D^(-1/2) 
	
	
	前人以证明该东西可以收敛
	
	
	4）学习部分：f(t+1) = alpha S f(t) + (1-alpha) y
	
	
	其中，用这个公式做传播，直到收敛
	
	
	第二部：在上面计算结果的基础上减掉句子多样性的分数
	
	
	1）按照第一步的计算将句子排序，从分数大到分数小
	
	
	2）先取出第一个，然后用公式减掉后面句子与其的相似度，R - w S fi , 其中w是个系数，用来当惩罚因子的
	
	
	最终实现了 不但考虑了相似度，又考虑了多样性的问题，最终得到一个完整的结果。},
