\emph{In this note paper, we report our experiment method at Ad-hoc task of Web Track 2013. We use meta search to help query expansion to increase the preformance. }

\section{Introduction}



\section{Our Method}

This year we attempt to put the query expansion techniology to the task. There are two main steps: query expansion and  ranking the search results.

\subsection{Query expansion}

In order to get better query expansion , we need to get some related resources about the query topic. Meta search is good choice to achive this goal.

\subsubsection{Meta search}

we use google search and bing search as a meta search resource. each search engine return the top 50 pages about the topic, and we use the page extract technology \cite{linshuang-block} to get main content and remove the spam pages.
